I was recently on the job market, and even though I ended up finding my new role through a personal connection, I did start to prep for a full-on job search. I also now have a handful of friends who are looking for work for a variety of reasons, so I wanted to share the strategy I had planned to undertake in the hopes that it'll be helpful to others.

My plan was to start with a relatively picky job search startegy: look for jobs at values-driven companies. For me, that means companies working in social impact or otherwise doing good in the world, working in a impact-focused field like climate or public health, or with a commitment to treating its workers well.

I compiled a list of job boards and signed up for a bunch of job alerts. I'm now using these boards to help folks in my network find a new job, and I've been quite pleased with the number of interesting jobs I've been able to discover. So even though I didn't personally end up using these, I'm pretty optimistic that they are relatively high-quality sources.

In general, my approach to looking for a job on any of these job sites is as follows:

1. Start by searching for the keyword or two related to the job title I want. I make sure to add any deal-breaker filters, like being remote.
2. If the keyword search yields only a handful of results, I'll repeat the search without any keyword, and instead just look for roles that meet my criteria. Then I just scroll through the titles to see if any catch my eye.
3. Once I stumble on an interesting company or a company that seems to have multiple postings on the board, I'll often take the extra step and go poke around its careers page to see if there are other open roles that I'm not seeing. I also take this extra step if I find a role that's no longer open, especially if it's a remote-first company with a cool mission.

# Job boards

Here are the job boards I've come across that seem to be of relatively high quality, meaning that they have: many opportunities, the ability to filter by remote jobs, and represent companies aligned with my values.
