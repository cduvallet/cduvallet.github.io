# Your changing role in the team

The most important part of growing a team as an early employee is recognizing your place within that team and adapting gracefully as it changes.

### Letting go of your legos

A blog post about scaling a startup wouldn't be complete without linking to the famous ["Letting go of your legos" article](https://review.firstround.com/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups).
But seriously, it's critical to be intentional about giving other people space to take over things that used to be your job.
Importantly though, it's very likely that they will do a worse job of it than you! 
They don't have the full context you do or the years of experience you have building a given process or project from scratch. 
But you _have_ to let them take your legos, _and also) give them space to make it their own.
When I first read that "give away your legos" article, I thought it'd be a piece of cake because of course I wanted people to take my jobs, I was doing way too many of them!
But actually, there's two parts to giving away your legos: the first is giving them away, which is fairly easy to do if you're experiencing burnout or you're not a high ego person.
The second is to let them make it their own, which is harder as an early employee because it means they might do a "worse" job of it than you.
But it's important to realize that there is often no "best" way to do something.
It's possible that the way they decide to do something is worse, or maybe it's just different.
It's also possible that they take your hacked-together solution and make it better, since it's now their _actual_ job to do this thing that used to be one of your millions of jobs. 
Second, even if they do do a "less good" job of something than you were doing, the company will still experience a net gain simply by having an improved [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).
In our case, it was way worth having a slightly less accurate QC process because it meant that we could hire junior data analysts to do it instead of having multiple scientific PhDs spending hours of their time going through rote QC.

## Don't grow too fast

- if this is one of your first jobs outside of school, don't be in a rush to get a "head of" or director title
  - give yourself space to discover what you actually like
  - i learned that i actually *don't* like (and am less effective at) a lot of the politics and relationship-leveraging needed to play an important strategic role. but because I was given the space to NOT be head of data science, i discovered that i DO love being a technical leader, and that's where i've been thriving. (it also meant that we got to hire a head of data science who i've learned so much from, from a career & personal growth perspective)

## Common inflection points

- inflection points
  - you're alone
  - you're not alone but you're in charge so you're still pretty alone
  - other people are in charge and you have peers
    - maybe you hired a boss, maybe not
  - you're just another employee: your team is larger than you directly control or have influence over 

## Remaining a leader

- you're still a leader, act like it
  - just by having been around a long time, you'll still be a leader - you know the context, you have all the scoops, you see the big picture. new folks will be excited to learn from you regardless of your actual role
  - your opinion will matter a lot, so be careful with it. as our company has grown larger and larger, i've made much more use of DMs - to share feedback  privately that in early days I would have put in a channel, to strategize a response to a tricky situation, to make sure i'm not overstepping on somebody else's work
