During my Luce Year, I worked as a lecturer for [Engineering World Health](ewh.org) at the [University of Puthisastra](http://www.puthisastra.edu.kh/).
I developed curricula for anatomy and physiology, troubleshooting skills, and math in the new Associate Bachelor's program in Biomedical Equipment Technology.
I prepared and delivered lectures, exams, assignments, in-class activities, and demos for two classes of 12-18 Cambodian students and technicians (in English, with a translator).
I also managed Cambodian student-teaching staff during my main supervisor's absence and supported foreign and local teaching staff.

My senior year at Columbia, I TAed the intro to engineering course for first year undergrads.
I assisted the students in designing and building a vital-signs monitoring device, guiding them through the engineering design process and teaching concepts in MATLAB and circuitry required for projects.
I also mentored and advised students on general biomedical engineering and college-related questions.
