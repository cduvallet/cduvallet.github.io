I was on a hike with my friend the other week and as we were talking about work, I kept using words that made things click in his head - words that he kept exclaiming: "wow that's a useful term! Wish I'd known that in my previous job!"
This conversation made me really appreciate the massive amount I've learned over the past few years of being an early employee at a rapidly growing bio/govtech startup.
A huge part of that learning has just been vocabulary - discovering words that can be used to describe and communicate about my situation.
Since I believe that no knowledge is too basic to share, I figured I'd write some of these words down.
Without further ado, a startup vocabulary lesson!

**Subject matter expert**

**Individual contributor (IC)** - someone who is not a people manager as their primary role. I've heard this described as something like: an IC is a person who codes; a manager is a person who manages the people who code.
This term was already familiar-ish to me, but I've gained a lot of nuanced understanding about what it can mean to be an IC, other than just "not a people manager." Importantly, IC does _not necessarily_ mean that (1) you code all the time and (2) you don't have any leadership or influence. In my situation, I rarely code at all but I still serve very much as an IC - it's just that my individual contributions are at a higher, more abstract level like designing architecture, reviewing tech specs, reviewing code, and mentoring. It's also not true that IC's don't have any leadership roles I still join our weekly data science leads, I am involved in many hiring decisions, and my manager turns to me as a trusted voice on questions of company goals and strategy. Being an IC just means that your primary job is not management, it's contributing to the _work_ of the company.
 
**Technical lead**

**Agile** - basically all of agile was unfamiliar to me before we started building our software team in-house.

**Architecture diagram** - early on, I remember trying to ask our contractors and junior engineers to "draw the boxes and arrows" to document our pipelines. Turns out there's a word for those beautiful pictures - architecture diagrams!

**Retros** - short for "retrospectives," retros were a game changer for me. Essentially, a retro is an event that you organize to look back on an incident, a project, or simply a period of time and reflect on what went well, what went poorly, and what could be improved. I like to describe it as a productive vent session - it's the time to air out all your frustrations, but because it's a sanctioned professional event, it also forces you to engage with those frustrations productively! 
My team hosts retros every two weeks at the end of our sprints. We also host retros on big incidents and large cross-departmental projects. 
When I was still the only lead on our data science team and managing four ICs who were in reality at or above my level, I was essentially the only conduit for them to raise and solve problems. But once we started implementing regular retros, we had a structured moment to collectively identify issues and collaborate on solving them. This took _so much_ pressure off of me, and was a great team-building experience. 
I also really love retros because they are a great place to sanity-check whether the thing that's bothering you is actually a big deal and bothering others, or something particular to you that you can just try to get over and let go.

**Technical debt**

**SLA** - service-level agreement. Essentially, it's the time by which you agree to resolve an issue. This is most often used in IT work, where the team has an SLA set for responding to and closing out tickets ("tickets must be responded to within Y minutes"). But you can also it to refer to something like "X task must be accomplished by Y time every day."
