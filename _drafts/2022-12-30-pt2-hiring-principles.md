Quite possibly the most valuable skill I've gained in the past two years as an early employee of a rapidly growing startup is hiring: hiring well (getting good candidates) and efficiently (with minimal pain).
Hiring has gone from one of my least favorite parts of working at a startup to something I look forward to and love to volunteer myself for.

Before I figured out how to hire, my hiring processes took _forever_ (many months) and were extremely emotionally draining.
I wasn't any good at writing reasonable job descriptions, I didn't have clear plans for the hiring process, and because I didn't have a good sense of what I needed I didn't really know how to evaluate candidates.
This meant that with every new candidate, I was essentially starting from scratch.
I remember so many DM's from our founder and VP of Engineering that were essentially like "ok so after X talks to Y candidate, who should we have them talk to next?"
We tried to over-engineer it by tailoring the interviewees to the candidate, and because our job descriptions were so broad and vague no candidates ever had a chance to make it through.
And because we'd waited to figure out the next step _after_ each call, it'd have taken months and they'd be pretty unenthusiastic about us by the time we were ready to extend an offer, if we ever got there.
It was bad for us, I assume it was bad for the candidates, and it was bad for the company.

But now! I _love_ hiring!
I also have very strong opinions on how to hire, and love telling them to anybody who will ask.
So who better to tell than the internet?
Join me on my soapbox, let's learn about hiring!

This was initially supposed to be a single post as part 4 of my "early employee lessons learned" series, but it got quite long so I'm splitting it into two.
In this first post I'll cover my general hiring principles; in the next one I'll share the nuts and bolts of how I set up my interview processes.

# Hiring principles

## Principle 1: Focus on signal

I come back to this one over and over again in a hiring process. When you're designing a panel or take-home, ask yourself: "will this give me the signal I need?" When you're conducting an interview: "have I gotten the signal I need? Where else do I need signal?" When an interview process is struggling: "are we missing some key signal in order to make this decision?" If you're not getting signal from something, then don't do it. If you've gotten the signal you need, then skip everything else that gets that same signal.

Importantly, the lack of signal is also signal itself: if an interview process isn't getting you the signal you need to confidently make decisions, then that's signal that you need to revisit your process.
If your panel is consistently having trouble evaluating a specific skillset for candidates, that's signal that you might need a different collection of people on your panel or that you may need to revisit the questions you're asking.

## Principle 2: Respect the candidate

Candidates are people, and more importantly they are _people you are not paying_. If you ask them to do an unreasonable amount of work or your process is unorganized and confusing, then that's pretty unfair to ask reasonable people to put up with _for free_. Excellent candidates won't stick around for a bad hiring process; they'll just go to another company who has their shit more together than you. 

Candidates are also _professionals_ who you are hiring because they are presumably good at something that you need. Respect their skillsets: don't put senior people through an insultingly basic technical interview, and don't put junior people through an impossibly difficult task. 
When we were hiring our head of software engineering, we were looking for someone who could still contribute as an IC and so had our technical interview set up to probe some of those low-level skillsets.
Then, we found ourselves interviewing a candidate who had been coding since my co-interviewer and I were babies. 
Instead of doing our standard technical panel, which would have been inappropriate and a little insulting, we scrapped what we had planned and engaged at a higher level.
We ended up hiring this candidate as our CTO!

Finally, candidates are _people_ - respect who they are, don't expect work to be their entire life, and recognize that they're coming from a totally different place than you. Take the extra moment to self-reflect and make sure you're not dinging someone because they have a different accent than you. Recognize that things which may be super simple to you are actually simple because you're an expert in your field, and in fact feel totally new and jargony to folks from other backgrounds. Think about what's going on in the world and adjust your expectations.
For example, we had a data science candidate who'd had a baby right at the beginning of Covid, and one of our interviewers thought it was strange that she hadn't played with Covid data at all. I reminded him that she had a baby during a pandemic, and so she was probably busy doing _that_ instead of playing with data. (He took my point well, disregarded that "signal", and we hired her!)
Ask yourself if weird communication style during the interview could be due to nerves, and if so, try to call them in a lower stress environment to get the signal that you need. 
And have empathy for things going on in their lives. Candidates are often juggling their current job alongside the hiring process, which can be very stressful.
I once had a candidate totally ghost me for a phone screen, only to scramble and apologize because she was on vacation and had totally lost track of time. Don't ding them for that too hard, just have empathy and remember all the times you had "oh shit" moments when you were on vacation and made the bad decision to commit to anything other than chilling! 

Bad processes that disrespect the candidates' time, skills, and humanity will weed out excellent individuals who can just go to another company that has better processes. At best, you'll be left with people who are _really_ excited about your company and are willing to wait and take a bet on you. But at worst, and I imagine most often, you'll be left with mediocre candidates who can afford to wait because they're not getting hired anywhere else.

## Principle 3: Keep it real

I try to keep every part of an interview process as close to what the candidate will do for their actual job as possible.

This is especially critical for the take-home: you're asking the candidates to spend time on something for you, so it's only fair that _they_ get something out of it as well.
If you put in the extra 20% of time and thought into developing a take-home that gets at the signal you need _and_ is also super relevant to what they'd be doing day-to-day, then at least _they_ also get signal on what they're getting themselves into. 
It doesn't even have to take that much effort to do - for example, instead of asking someone to interpret a generic architecture diagram, draw up a toy example of something in your stack, give them all the context they need to interpret it, and ask the same questions you would have asked in the generic example.
Or, instead of giving them a generic data science coding exercise, give them some of your toy data! Explain what the data that you usually work with looks like, give them a much smaller subset of it, and let them go crazy.
That way, you get to see how they code, and they get to see if they'd even like working with whatever type of data you have.

Keeping it real also applies in developing the panels: make sure that the people they will directly work with are on the panel, and be very explicit about it.
When I'm hiring for a senior or manager role, I introduce the group presentation with "these are the people on your team. Ask them anything you want, they are literally the people you will work with/manage."
I also love going through "hypothetical" scenarios which are actually not hypothetical at all - this gives you great signal on how candidates approach problems that they will _actually_ need to solve, and it gives them great signal on the types of problems they'll be asked to solve.

It all combines into a really fun experience: you give the candidate a watered-down version of a problem you are _actually_ facing, and they get to work with you to find a solution with the people they would _actually_ be working with.
After an interview like that, the candidates don't have to ask "what's the job like?" and you don't have to struggle through an answer!

## Principle 4: Respect the panel

Finally, it's critical to respect the panel and set them up for success. When you're leading a hiring process, you're asking for a lot of time from a lot of people. It's critical that you make good use of that time.

Set the panel up for success: be very clear about what the role is, where it fits within the company, how individuals on your panel would work with this person, what you're looking for in a candidate, and how the interview process will go.

Give the panel clear expectations and guidance: when you're talking about evaluation criteria, give your panel examples of a bad candidate, a good candidate, and an exceptional candidate. If you have multiple interviews in the process, be clear about your intention for each one: what signal is each interviewer trying to get at?
Tell your panel how you'd like to receive their feedback, and give them the scale you're expecting them to use.
(I like to do a 1-4 rating, because it forces people to choose a rating _not_ in the middle.)

Respecting the panel also means keeping them informed about how the process is going. 
I like to make a slack channel for the panel (make it private, so that the candidate you eventually hire can't see any chatter about them) and share updates periodically.
If you have a million phone screens coming up, let them know!
If you're not finding anyone good, share that.
And most importantly, if you've decided to extend an offer or have heard back from a candidate, _let them know_ - your panel has put in a lot of time to this effort, and they deserve to know what's going on.
I was once on a panel for a science communications manager, and we interviewed someone who was not right for the role but a truly _amazing_ catch for the company at-large. My co-interviewer and I submitted extremely positive feedback to the tune of "not hiring this candidate for _any role_ would be a huge mistake". We didn't hear _anything_ about this candidate until one day at all-hands it was announced that she was starting in a few weeks for a role we hadn't heard about.
I was excited that we'd decided to hire her, but felt offended that my time and enthusiasm weren't respected enough to warrant an FYI from the hiring manager.

It's also your job to keep the panel on track - if you're feeling that the panel is straying from your vision of the role, then it's your job to get everyone together to clarify expectations and build consensus on what everyone should be looking for.
Sometimes someone on the panel feels an acute need in their job that won't necessarily be filled by the  role you're hiring for. But because of their acute problem, they may still be looking for that skillset, either consciously or subconsciously. It sucks, but you have to remind them that we're not hiring to solve their specific problem (yet). 
Recently, we interview one candidate who wasn't quite the right fit for an open role, but he did have some excellent python and pandas skills. One of my co-interviewers was so excited about this because they're currently our primary pandas expert. But we had to remind them: "we're hiring for a data scientist comma automation, not comma pandas." They were bummed, but agreed that given the role we're trying to fill, their favorite candidate was actually not a great fit.

Your panel may also need to be periodically reminded about the expected leveling for a role. If the panel's feedback makes it clear that they're holding out for a unicorn or if their feedback is unfairly harsh given the level you're hiring for, it's useful to level-set when reviewing feedback.

Finally, respecting the panel means making sure that they feel heard and have buy-in to whatever decision you're making.
This can be accomplished super easily, with synchronous sessions to review feedback after each batch of candidates who make it through the whole process.
Even if the answer is a clear yes or no, I find it helpful to still get the panel together - if it's a no, the discussion can help elucidate how to improve the process next time or what signal to focus on more. If it's a yes, then meeting can build excitement and conviction before extending an offer!
That said, hiring someone is not a democracy. Not everyone's vote gets the same weight, and the hiring manager has the final say.
If you're going to up- or down-weight someone's vote, make sure to communicate about that to the panel.
For example, if I'm hiring for a people manager, I usually give their future direct reports veto power over hiring someone. (Of course, making sure that if they do want to veto a hire, it's not driven by bias, unreasonable expectations, or misconceptions about the role).
