Transitions

pt 1: letting go of your legos
- as an early employee, your whole job is to let go of your legos and transition
- i spent a year doing this

strategies
- document everything / every knowledge transfer is an opportunity for documentation
- don't feel bad about not wanting the other person's job - it's why you hired them! (computer kyle and sw engs, annie, alex m)
- give them space to make it their own (also let them fail and learn the lessons the hard way themselves / you can't protect them forever)
- remain available / don't abandon them
- make clear transition plans (dqops transition document), include some "official" announcement (even if by then it's mostly a formality)
- constanntly revisit the channels and meetings your'e a part of. donn't feel weird to revisit your participation, change up your 1:1's, etc

pt 2: transitioning out of the company

my situation was pretty ideal: hard times, but got to a point where things were good

basically a year-long transition for myself:
- get my mental health back / recover from burn out / benefit from the hard work i'd put in
- re-engage my professional brain and network
- look for the next thing

maybe you need to do this privately, or maybe you've agreed with your company that it's hard to find you a role in the changing org. it's not a crazy idea to ask for 6 months to figure out your next move.

if it's your choice, it sucks but don't tell anybody until you have a signed offer - unless there's something (reasonable) they could do to make you stay

emotionally, it actually only got easier
- hardest: when i knew but nobody else did
- easier: told me boss and closest colleagues
- easiest: once i started telling people, they were just excited for me

pt 3: two weeks and leaving a remote role - published!
