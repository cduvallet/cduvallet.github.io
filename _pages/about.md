As of May 2023, I'm joining [Science for America](https://www.scienceforamerica.org/) to identify and support game-changing solutions to improve equity in STEM and public health.

Before SfA, I was the founding data scientist at [Biobot Analytics](www.biobot.io), a startup transforming sewers into public health observatories.
In my role, I provided high-level technical feedback on a variety of data science and software engineering projects, served as a key subject matter expert on wastewater-based epidemiology within the company and on external calls, and was the technical point-person for our federal contracts with HHS and CDC.
As a founding employee, I also helped the company grow from 5 to 150+ people, and am especially proud of building Biobot's data science team from the ground up with an emphasis on fostering a collaborative and transparent culture.

Before joining Biobot, I received my PhD from the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT.
I worked in [Eric Alm's lab](http://almlab.mit.edu), studying the relationship between the human microbiome and health and disease.
Before that, I lived for a year in Cambodia working for [Engineering World Health](http://www.ewh.org/) as a [Luce Scholar](http://www.hluce.org/lsprogram.aspx).
Before that, I studied biomedical engineering at Columbia University.
