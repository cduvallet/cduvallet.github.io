I'm the founding data scientist at [Biobot Analytics](www.biobot.io), a startup transforming sewers into public health observatories.
As a technical lead on Biobotâ€™s data science team, I provide technical subject matter expertise across a variety of projects and programs. In my role, I work closely with the data science team as a contributor and advisor on R&D projects, serve as a technical advisor and representative on cross-company programs, and bridge scientists and software engineers within Biobot.

Before joining Biobot, I received my PhD from the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT.
I worked in [Eric Alm's lab](http://almlab.mit.edu), studying the relationship between the human microbiome and health and disease.
Before that, I lived for a year in Cambodia working for [Engineering World Health](http://www.ewh.org/) as a [Luce Scholar](http://www.hluce.org/lsprogram.aspx).
Before that, I studied biomedical engineering at Columbia University.
