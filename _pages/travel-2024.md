## [Nov 12, Cassopolis, MI -> Chicago](#nov12)

Dipped down to 40 degrees last night, I was ok but I'm a little worried about Ellie. She seemed very unhappy this morning - could be the cold, the wind, or the faffing who knows.

We met some goats this morning! Practiced our "frustrated greeter" training and she did great.

Found a nearby park for a longer jaunt, saw that lots of people were running so decided to go for a run myself. We saw a deer (in the trail!) and a dog. I'm a pretty big fan of these trails mowed into tall meadows - they feel a bit like a maze. Loved being out with the sun shining.

Next stop Chicago! But I noticed a sign for Indiana Dunes National Park and saw that it wasn't a huge detour - _screech_ what's a road trip if you don't make time for a cheeky lil' national park detour?? The dunes were nice, very reminiscent of Cape Cod. Ellie had some great sand sniffs and was very cute by the water - dodging waves while trying to eat what I thought was rocks (turns out it was treats I dropped).

Made it to Quentin's in Chicago. Went for a walk and our frustrated greeter did a great job! She smelled SO MANY city smells and saw lots of dogs, most of which she was relatively calm for. We were even able to approach one set of dogs and she got to say hi because she was calm. We're so proud.

Then a Biobot reunion hang out at Quentin's. So nice to see Gordon and Cameron, hear what they're been up to, and reminisce with the gift of time passed.

## [Nov 11, Waterford, PA -> Cassopolis, MI](#nov11)

I slept great! First car breakfast went fine but definitely took longer than I'd like.

Hit the road but had a bit of faffing trying to find an Atlas obscura art installation. It was clearly just someone's yard so I didn't stop.

Then it took another bit to find but found myself in a super lovely park with a huge meadow with mazes of trails through it and woods along the edges. It was lovely and quiet so had lunch at the picnic tables. I really wanted to catch one last look at gorges, so I stopped at a hiking area an hour away. Wasn't what I expected (no gorges) but still fun to walk on the shale river bed!

Then drive drive drive to just a couple hours outside Chicago. It was crazy windy - I tanked my average mpg!

Sleeping at my second harvest host, this time at a farm. Much smaller and harder to find a flat spot, and less clear walking space for l-dawg. Ramen and Nutella bread for dinner, which was tricky because it's so windy. Ellie ate half her dinner outside but then wanted to go in, she was not loving this place.

## [Nov 10, Ithaca -> Waterford, PA](#nov10)

I decided to hike with Ilana in the morning instead of going to Letchworth State Park like I planned, in part because it was gonna be raining but also friendship. We had a nice hike through some gorges, then went to another gorge (but it was rainy and I could only hike around the top). Realized I've got some work to do on the Ellie + Claire selfie situation.

Stopped at a highway rest stop and took a nice walk, which brought us to a MASSIVE leach field.

My spot for the night is my first [Harvest Hosts](https://www.harvesthosts.com/) experience, at [Poverty Knob Farmhouse Ales](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SA2mU3o68DKBgEjG7): really really nice. Took Ellie into the brewery, a group of friends were playing a dice game and were very sweet towards Ellie (they wanted to pet her but then left her alone when they saw how nervous she was). I had a fine burger and beer, then parked in the corner of the massive parking lot. They grow rows of pine trees which were really nice to walk through by the light of the moon.

## [Nov 9, Home -> Ithaca, NY](#nov9)

And we're off!! Oof I feel so nauseous - I'm so nervous about this what if it's a terrible idea ahhh

Oh hi Vermont! Pulled off the road because Ellie seemed really unhappy, turns out I pulled into Ellie's first covered bridge! Still really nervous after our short walk: just won't settle, is panting like crazy, and full body shaking when I stop. ðŸ˜­

Took a quick lil' hike on the Appalachian trail. Turns out the hike goes straight up woops. Ellie has a poop, I'm really hopeful she'll be better. Which, yes - when we're off again she sleeps most of the drive, thank god.

Made it to my first stop Ithaca to see Ilana (former postdoc in my PhD lab)! Her daughters were so sweet with Ellie, they handed her treats while turning their heads away. Ellie has a few face offs with the cat but no lunging or barking. So nice to catch up with Ilana and swap stories from the last year.
