## [Nov 16, Lexington, NE -> Denver, CO](#nov16)

Another great Nebraska day!! Today was pretty chill, since I only had about 5 hours to drive and would lose an hour with the time change, but my AirBnB check-in wasn't till 3 pm.

As usual, I looked for a place to hike about 2 hours into my driving time. I hadn't found anywhere that looked awesome, so I opted for a lake just outside of Ogallala (Lake McConaughy) and figured there would be something to do there. And there sure was! Ellie and I went on a long adventure scrambling along the shoreline. There was lake to one side and cliff-y slopes to the other so I let her off leash again, this time for much longer! We both had a lot of fun.

Then just driving straight to the AirBnb, with a lovely chat with Scott at the tail end.  Planning to have Torchy's for dinner, catch up on my various journalings (including doing some painting!) but also am feeling extremely lazy so might just curl up with Ellie and watch some TV.

## [Nov 15, Des Moines, IA -> Lexington, NE](#nov15)

I found some toilets in the morning at the nearby playground, I know you all were so worried for me! That was just the beginning of a great morning -- lazy morning at the campground, chatting with Megan, catching up a bit on work, and doing some box game (nose work) training with Ellie. 

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241115_152346294.jpg" width="45%">

Went on a walk and found a beach along the river, figured I'd try to let Ellie off leash. She was so happy!!! And overall decently responsive! It was nerve wracking for me but so nice to see her run full speed for the first time in a week. 

I then headed off to Lincoln Nebraska for perhaps the most important stop of the trip so far: the International Quilt Museum. I'd seen it show up on my Google maps earlier and it was a no-brainer that I'd go. I took Ellie on a lovely sunny walk through a prairie meadow while chatting with Megan again before we headed to the museum. We had some off leash time again, and she did great again. (Ellie, not Megan). I'm really digging meadows on this trip. 

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241115_204355218.jpg" width="45%">

Got to the museum 30 minutes before they closed, but turns out they were having a crafts market and were open late! I saw some really beautiful quilts, including one room full of striking red themed quilts that made me squeal with glee when I opened the door into the gallery. (I love these moments!) 

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241115_214035253.jpg" width="45%">

There were millions of squirrels in the parking lot so getting Ellie to pee before leaving was out of the question, instead I stopped at the next highway rest stop and got to enjoy a stunning sunset. 

Then I was off to my Harvest Host which was at a winery/brewery/cidery that allowed dogs inside. The owner was so sweet, the cider was delicious, and the ambiance was super lovely. I'm really loving getting the chance to practice bringing Ellie into establishments, given that these places tend to be quite empty and relaxed.

I also booked a last-minute AirBnB for Denver tomorrow -- I was hoping to stay with friends in Denver, but no one was able to host me and it was going to be too cold to sleep in the car. Big fan of solving problems with money, and of choosing reasonableness and comfort over frugality. Oh, how I've changed since my youth!

I gotta give it to you Nebraska, today was a pretty great day. On my last road trip, Nebraska was by far my least favorite state (though to be fair it was gray and rainy and I was sick). Maybe I was wrong!

## [Nov 14, Chicago -> Des Moines, IA](#nov14)

Took Ellie to a new park for our morning walk that I saw had some brush area last night when I drove home. It did but it was no pets allowed, so we walked along the perimeter. She squeezed in between the fence posts and immediately peed and pooped once she was in tall grass. This lady likes her privacy!

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241114_141033824.jpg" width="45%">

She's also doing much better with dog reactivity, there was a group of off leash dogs in the park she barely looked at. Only a couple of lunges on this walk, definite progress. Unfortunately as her dog reactivity gets better, it seems that her reactivity to squirrels is getting worse. That, or city squirrels just have no fear and she feels insulted by their audacity. It's less problematic than barking at dogs, but way more annoying to me because she is unmoveable when she fixates on a squirrel.

Did a bit of work and just enough faffing to still be at questions Quentin's at 11:30 when the boba shop nearby opened. Huzzah! (It was the best boba I've had in a _long time_ - so good!!) But tragedy: no boba till noon. It's ok I had some delicious green milk tea as a consolation.

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241114_180849068.MP.jpg" width="45%"> <img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241114_180830387.jpg" width="45%"> 

I left Quentin with some art to help him decrate his new apartment and then was off to Starved Rock State Park, per Sam's recommendation. Very lovely park, some pretty sweet canyon/gorge views (bonus gorges!!) and a great network of boardwalk paths. It was perfect to practice asking for an Ellie sit at every fork in the trail, which my trainer recommended. By the end I think she was starting to get it! 

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241114_204355045.jpg" width="45%"> 

Then drive drive drive to Des Moines. I'm listening to a devastating podcast series from 99 PI about the tangible impacts of climate change *today*. I need like a week in between each episode to build back up to listening the next one, too real (but so good). Had a bit of cry which very cathartic, driving down the dark road and in your feels. Picked up some dinner in Des Moines (which has a surprising number of places that stay open till 9 or 10!) Made a game time decision to get pizza and a salad, probably overkill woops. Also my Greek salad only had one single cherry tomato in it wtf! The small injustices in life...

Made it to the campground which is just twenty minutes from the city. It seems very cute but also I was annoyed that the campground restrooms were closed, and there didn't seem to be any others! It's funny to me to pay $30 for just a slab of concrete and no other services, but I understand that there's still maintenance and staff.

## [Nov 13, Chicago](#nov13)

Lazy workday in Chicago today. Ellie was so so happy to just splay on the couch all day, and I felt good getting caught up on work stuff. I'd thought I could do some work in the car when I got to places for the evening but so far 2/2 nights I've just ended up napping with Ellie before going to bed, hah! When she gets cozy her energy is just magnetic...

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241113_181339613.jpg" width="45%">

I also booked almost every stop till Utah, which feels really good. I think the stress of not knowing where I'll be staying followed by the release of figuring out is something I really enjoy about road tripping, weirdly enough. It's the roller coaster, but also the constant remembering that everything is gonna be okay, actually - it'll all work out.

It's also very nice to not be as money constrained as last time. If I'm finding it tough to find a free camping spot I can just literally solve the problem with money. Tomorrow I'm staying in a campground just outside Des Moines which I had to pay for but whatever, it's super convenient and means I don't have to rush for any check-in time.

Ellie is doing alright in the city. She really hated last night's walk and this morning, but last night was very windy and this morning had lots of construction noise so it makes sense. 

I met up with Sam tonight and we tried to introduce our dogs to each other, but they just weren't having it. It was only a bit of a bummer since we were kind of expecting it to not work out, and I was glad to be able to learn more about Ellie's response to challenging situtations. I ended up leaving Ellie in the car while we had dinner at their place, which was quite lovely. When I leave her in the car she does settle in her bed and seems to chill out, which is a big relief! Had delicious tacos and catch up time with Sam, and then on the drive home we stopped at a park that was blissfully empty and had some brush area for Ellie to comfortably pee and poop. 

I am extremely bad at remembering to take pictures with my human friends, so I alas have no proof of either seeing Sam or the Biobot crew.

## [Nov 12, Cassopolis, MI -> Chicago](#nov12)

Dipped down to 40 degrees last night, I was ok but I'm a little worried about Ellie. She seemed very unhappy this morning - could be the cold, the wind, or the faffing who knows.

We met some goats this morning! Practiced our "frustrated greeter" training and she did great.

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241112_125519267.MP.jpg" width="45%">

Found a nearby park for a longer jaunt, saw that lots of people were running so decided to go for a run myself. We saw a deer (in the trail!) and a dog. I'm a pretty big fan of these trails mowed into tall meadows - they feel a bit like a maze. Loved being out with the sun shining.

Next stop Chicago! But I noticed a sign for Indiana Dunes National Park and saw that it wasn't a huge detour - _screech_ what's a road trip if you don't make time for a cheeky lil' national park detour?? The dunes were nice, very reminiscent of Cape Cod. Ellie had some great sand sniffs and was very cute by the water - dodging waves while trying to eat what I thought was rocks (turns out it was treats I dropped).

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241112_192934497.jpg" width="45%">

Made it to Quentin's in Chicago. Went for a walk and our frustrated greeter did a great job! She smelled SO MANY city smells and saw lots of dogs, most of which she was relatively calm for. We were even able to approach one set of dogs and she got to say hi because she was calm. We're so proud.

Then a Biobot reunion hang out at Quentin's. So nice to see Gordon and Cameron, hear what they're been up to, and reminisce with the gift of time passed.

## [Nov 11, Waterford, PA -> Cassopolis, MI](#nov11)

I slept great! First car breakfast went fine but definitely took longer than I'd like.

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241111_133224142.jpg" width="45%">

Hit the road but had a bit of faffing trying to find an Atlas obscura art installation. It was clearly just someone's yard so I didn't stop.

Then it took another bit to find but found myself in a super lovely park with a huge meadow with mazes of trails through it and woods along the edges. It was lovely and quiet so had lunch at the picnic tables. I really wanted to catch one last look at gorges, so I stopped at a hiking area an hour away. Wasn't what I expected (no gorges) but still fun to walk on the shale river bed! 

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241111_182330529.jpg" width="45%">

Then drive drive drive to just a couple hours outside Chicago. It was crazy windy - I tanked my average mpg!

Sleeping at my second harvest host, this time at a farm. Much smaller and harder to find a flat spot, and less clear walking space for l-dawg. Ramen and Nutella bread for dinner, which was tricky because it's so windy. Ellie ate half her dinner outside but then wanted to go in, she was not loving this place.

## [Nov 10, Ithaca -> Waterford, PA](#nov10)

I decided to hike with Ilana in the morning instead of going to Letchworth State Park like I planned, in part because it was gonna be raining but also friendship. We had a nice hike through some gorges, then went to another gorge (but it was rainy and I could only hike around the top). Realized I've got some work to do on the Ellie + Claire selfie situation.

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241110_193043017.jpg" width="45%">

Stopped at a highway rest stop and took a nice walk, which brought us to a MASSIVE leach field.

My spot for the night is my first [Harvest Hosts](https://www.harvesthosts.com/) experience, at [Poverty Knob Farmhouse Ales](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SA2mU3o68DKBgEjG7): really really nice. Took Ellie into the brewery, a group of friends were playing a dice game and were very sweet towards Ellie (they wanted to pet her but then left her alone when they saw how nervous she was). I had a fine burger and beer, then parked in the corner of the massive parking lot. They grow rows of pine trees which were really nice to walk through by the light of the moon.

## [Nov 9, Home -> Ithaca, NY](#nov9)

And we're off!! Oof I feel so nauseous - I'm so nervous about this what if it's a terrible idea ahhh

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241109_155430609.jpg" width="45%">

Oh hi Vermont! Pulled off the road because Ellie seemed really unhappy, turns out I pulled into Ellie's first covered bridge! Still really nervous after our short walk: just won't settle, is panting like crazy, and full body shaking when I stop. 😭

<img src="/images/2024/PXL_20241109_171856169.jpg" width="45%">

Took a quick lil' hike on the Appalachian trail. Turns out the hike goes straight up woops. Ellie has a poop, I'm really hopeful she'll be better. Which, yes - when we're off again she sleeps most of the drive, thank god.

Made it to my first stop Ithaca to see Ilana (former postdoc in my PhD lab)! Her daughters were so sweet with Ellie, they handed her treats while turning their heads away. Ellie has a few face offs with the cat but no lunging or barking. So nice to catch up with Ilana and swap stories from the last year.
