## [Nov 16, NYC -> VA](#nov15)

Great Brooklyn morning with off-leash time in Prospect Park before a delicious bagel and matcha.
Last time I was in New York, Ellie had kennel cough so I couldn't let her off leash, and the time before that
I wasn't confident in her off-leash manners or her recall so I kept her leashed. My how we've grown!

Ellie didn't really know what to do with herself there were so many dogs. But she finally started to play
right as I was ready to head back home. First with a dog named Enzo, and then as I was just about to leave the
off-leash area I recognized someone's voice - it was some friends from undergrad that I haven't seen in years!
What a small world, running into people you know in NYC...

Original intention for today was to make it to Little Devil's Stairs hike in Shenandoah,
but I did some sunset back-calculating math and realized we'd have to leave by like 9 am to 
make it reasonable. So we pivoted and went to a winery ten min from the Airbnb, and then to a brewery
(with just fine pizza) 10 min away from that. Who would've ever thought I'd have a brewery dog. Not me,
I'm so happy.

## [Nov 15, Home -> NYC](#nov14)

Easy peasy, 5 hour drive to NYC. Shockingly beat the google maps estimate, 
found parking one block away from Megan's apartment, and Ellie peed between the car
and the apartment.

(I'm so excited to be so much less preoccupied with Ellie's bathrooming this trip - so glad
she's a city dog now who understand that walks are when you bathroom.)
