I am available for consulting for early-stage startups. If you're interested in exploring if there's a fit, email me at cduvallet@gmail.com and we'll talk!

## Technical advisor & tech lead

In the early days of building a startup, it can be difficult to know which technical problems are worth spending time on vs. which ones can be _wisely_ solved with a "good enough" approach.

I can provide feedback and perspectives on setting strong technical foundations for your startup: which decisions are important to invest in right now and which can be pushed until you've reached a different scale, easy things you can do now that will pay huge dividends as you grow, and thinking through questions of build vs. buy. 

Depending on your company's domain, I can likely serve as an early technical lead. I can work with your scientists or subject matter experts to review their work, help them frame their questions, and connect their results back to the bigger picture company needs. I'm also skilled at serving as a bridge between scientists or subject matter experts and software engineers: I can provide subject matter expertise from either side to smooth communication between internal teams and/or outside vendors.

I can also provide IC support to develop schemas, process diagrams, and other critical documentation. 

## Computational biology, bioinformatics, and data science

I also provide computational biology, bioinformatics, and/or data science services. Given my limited availability, I'm best suited for short-term projects that have a clear goal or deliverable, or longer-term projects that are not company-critical. In an IC role, I find myself adding the most value to projects where the internal team is leading the scientific direction and I implement some sort of (usually scrappy) pipeline to make their ideas real.

## Early employee peer coach & advisor

Being one of the first few employees at a startup can be lonely and uniquely challenging. 

I'm available to support your early employees however they need: strategizing, sanity-checking, problem-solving, venting, or anything that another colleague would support them on. I can also provide coaching support, helping them develop conflict resolution skills and figuring out their path forward in their career.

And as your team grows, I'm available as a sounding board as your early leaders develop their team cultures, management styles, and workplace rituals.
