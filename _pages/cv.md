# Research experience

**Alm lab**, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2014-2019)   
*Under the direction of Eric Alm*

I did my PhD in [Eric Alm's lab](http://almlab.mit.edu/) at MIT.
You can learn more about my research interests on my [research](/research/) and [publications](/publications/) pages.
You can download my [thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/elvp8qzrz3zsjyx/duvallet_thesis_final.pdf?dl=0) and [defense slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j4b11wa8a4r42j8/2019-01-11.defense.pdf?dl=0), and also view them on my [github](https://github.com/cduvallet/phd-thesis).

**Molecular and Microscale Bioengineering Laboratory**, Columbia University (2011-2013)
*Under the direction of Samuel K. Sia*

I was an undergraduate research assistant in [Sam Sia](http://bme.columbia.edu/samuel-k-sia)'s lab for two years at Columbia.
There, I worked on developing a point-of-care microfluidic device to diagnose multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.
I primarily focused on the DNA amplification and detection modules, optimizing primers and reaction conditions off-chip.

**Laboratoire de Biochimie**, Ecole Polytechnique (Summer 2012)   
*Under the direction of Cedric Norais*

I was an international undergraduate research intern at Ecole Polytechnique the summer before my senior year.
There, I worked with Cedric Norais to study the acquired-immunity CRISPR system in E. coli.
